    <History>Antiochus inherited a troubled kingdom upon the beginning of his reign. From the verge of collapse he managed to weld back together the empire Seleukus I so hard to found. The rebellious eastern satraps of Bactria and Parthia were brought to heel , temporarily securing his eastern borders. He then turned his attention to mother Greece, attempting to fulfill the dreams of his fathers by invading Greece under the pretext of "liberation". The Achaean League and the Kingdom of Pergamon banded together with the Romans to defeat him at the Battle of Magnesia, forever burying the dream of reuniting Alexander's empire.</History>

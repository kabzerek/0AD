		"Description" : "Each player starts on a hill surrounded by steep cliffs\n\nCantabria is a mountainous region north of the Iberian peninsula. Because of the gulf stream, Cantabria, as well as the rest of Green Spain, has a much more temperate climate than might be expected for its latitude, which is comparable to that of Oregon. The region has a humid oceanic climate, with warm summers and mild winters. The first written reference to the name Cantabria emerges around 195 BC, in which the historian Cato the Elder speaks in his book Origins about the source of the Ebro River in the country of the Cantabri. The Cantabri were used as mercenaries in various conflicts, both within the Iberian Peninsula and elsewhere. It is certain that they participated in the war of the Carthaginians against Rome during the Second Punic War.",

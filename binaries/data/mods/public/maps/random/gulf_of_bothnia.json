		"Description" : "Players start around a gulf dotted with small islands.\n\nThe Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. Into the gulf flow a number of rivers from both sides; consequently, a salinity gradient exists from north to south. In the south the water is the normal brackish water of the Baltic Sea, but in the north, in the Bothnian Bay, the salinity is so low, from 0.4 percent near Kvarken to 0.2 percent in the northernmost part, that one can no longer taste the salt in the water and many freshwater fish thrive in it. The icing of the Baltic Sea begins and ends in the Gulf of Bothnia.",

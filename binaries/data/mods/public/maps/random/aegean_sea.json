		"Description" : "Players start in two sides of a sea with scattered islands\n\nAegean Sea is a part of Mediterranean Sea between southern Balkan and Anatolia. There are more than 100 islands located in the region. By the game's timeline, nearly all of the inhabitants of the areas surrounding the sea were Greek. Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbors and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than traveling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland (and to some extent the coastal areas of Anatolia). Many of the islands are volcanic, and marble and iron are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains.",

		"Description" : "The players start on two opposing islands, both with a very jagged relief that will make landing difficult.\n\nCorsica is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located west of Italy, southeast of the French mainland, and north of the island of Sardinia. Mountains comprise two-thirds of the island, forming a single chain. Sardinia is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and before Cyprus). Originally occupied by the Torreans, then marginally settled by Etruscans, Phocaeans and Syracusans. Rome conquered these two islands from Carthage during the First Punic War and in 238 BC created the \"Corsica et Sardinia\" province. The Corsicans regularly revolted and over the course of a century, the island lost two thirds of its Corsican population.",
